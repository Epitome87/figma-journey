# Figma Journey

This respository simply serves as self-motivation and logging of my studying and practicing of Figma.

I began learning Figma on 10/17/2021. I hope to gain a strong enough understanding of the tool to start making it part of my pre-coding routine when developing websites. This will help greatly in brainstorming and designing the look of a webpage rather than going in blind to code one.

## Works So Far

### Simple Designer UI/UX Webpage

In this guided project by Gary Simon (found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu1so3pz4bA), I learned the very basics of Figma. The project was a fairly simple landing page for a Designer-for-hire. It features standard navigation elements, call-to-action section, an illustration, and user avatar cards. It also has two small sub-pages, which were mostly designed to teach the Prototype functioanlity (such as smart animations).

Until I organize this repository and flesh out the README, you can find this project in the `Matthew's 1st Design Practice.fig` file.
